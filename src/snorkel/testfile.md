# Example Project Report

Overview of project [Bob](ns:project#bob) [written on 29th Feb, 2016](ns:date#2016-02-2 'report compiled on')

Bob is a [useless bastard](ns:role#ba) who can't find his arse with an atlass

[became redundant on](ns:date#2016-02-2 'report redacted on')

The Project had some non funcitonal requirements mostly as an excuse for some data types and units

The damn thing was supposed to spin at [five thousand rpm](ns:rpm#5000 'required performance')

It only even managed to get up to about [1k](ns:rpm#5000 'achived performace') though which is not damn use.
